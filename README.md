## ❯❯ About
Our end goal here is to allow every member of this couse to have the resources and ability to create programs and learn from their mistakes. Lesson 1's main goal is to get the members used to the services necessary for the couse. This includes environment installation and usage.

### Section 1 - Introduction
Hello, my name is Kura and I am here to teach some basics of programming. This class starts with HTML/CSS and will progress onto JS as well as standalone JS applications with the use of Node.JS and Express. 

This class was initially made for helping one person but after a few more people found interest in such a class I have decided to expand this process beyond just a person as well as record the development for future reference and give the students the ability to review the ideas presented.

On the first day it is best to start with introductions of who is experienced in which topics as well as start by setting up the environmental applications necessary for the class. This will explore two important parts of the entire course. First, it will allow me to understand how experienced everyone in the class is in the fields explored and secondly it will let me know how well each person is as following instructions. It is necessary for me to understand how experienced someone is because it will allow me to either give them a task of higher understanding or allow me to spend more time with the people that need help. And having to set up an environment while watching someone else do it will help me understand how much I can depend on someone to interpret the instructions properly.

### Section 2 - Setup

Pre-requisite: A GitHub account.

This section introduces very simple and fast installations of all the necessary applications for the entire course. Since the desired topics to explore are HTML, CSS, JS, Node.JS, Discord.JS and a touch on a few other JS libraries, it is best to install a few prerequisites to make the class easy.
